Microsoft-Windows-DriverFrameworks-UserMode|10110|System|A problem has occurred with one or more user-mode drivers and the hosting process has been terminated.  This may temporarily interrupt your ability to access the devices.
Microsoft-Windows-DriverFrameworks-UserMode|10111|System|The device {FriendlyName} (location {Location}) is offline due to a user-mode driver crash.  Windows will attempt to restart the device {RestartCount} more times.  Please contact the device manufacturer for more information about this problem.
Microsoft-Windows-DriverFrameworks-UserMode|10112|System|The device {FriendlyName} (location {Location}) is offline due to a user-mode device crash.  Windows will no longer attempt to restart this device because the maximum restart limit has been reached.  Disconnecting the device and reconnecting it, or disabling it and re-enabling it from the device manager, will reset this limit and allow the device to be accessed again.  Please contact the device manufacturer for more information about this problem.
Microsoft-Windows-DriverFrameworks-UserMode|10113|System|The device {InstanceId} was unable to start due to conflict between the settings for driver {DriverName} ({ConflictingParameter} - {Value}) and the other drivers.  Windows will not be able to start this device.  Please contact the device manufacturer for assistance.
