Usually, this indicates that the principal does not have direct security permissions or lacks membership in a group that has direct access permissions. To determine and correct the permissions on the specified share, an administrator can use the Security tab in File Explorer Properties dialog, the SMBSHARE Windows PowerShell module, or the NET SHARE command. You can also use the Effective Access tab in File Explorer to help diagnose the issue.Applications may generate access denied errors if they attempt to open files in a writable mode first, and then reopen the files in a read-only mode. In this case, no user action is required.If access to the share is denied and this event is not logged, you can examine the file and folder NTFS/REFS permissions.This error does not indicate a problem with authentication, only authorization.
Microsoft-Windows-SMBServer  |  1007      |  Microsoft-Windows-SMBServer/Security      |  The share denied anonymous access to the client.Client Name: {ClientName}Client Address: {ClientAddress}Share Name: {ShareName}Share Path: {SharePath}Guidance:You should expect this error when a client attempts to connect to shares and does not provide any credentials. This indicates that the client is not providing a user name (and domain credentials, if necessary). By default, anonymous access to shares is denied.This error does not always indicate a problem with authorization, but mainly authentication. It is more common with non-Windows clients.
Microsoft-Windows-SMBServer  |  1009      |  Microsoft-Windows-SMBServer/Security      |  The server denied anonymous access to the client.Client Name: {ClientName} Client Address: {ClientAddress}Session ID: {SessionId}Guidance:You should expect this error when a client attempts to connect to shares and does not provide any credentials. This indicates that the client is not providing a user name (and domain credentials, if necessary). By default, Windows Server denies anonymous access to shares.This error does not always indicate a problem with authorization, but mainly authentication. It is more common with non-Windows clients.

Microsoft-Windows-SMBServer  |  1021      |  Microsoft-Windows-SMBServer/Security      |  LmCompatibilityLevel value is different from the default.Configured LM Compatibility Level: {ConfiguredLmCompatibilityLevel}Default LM Compatibility Level: {DefaultLmCompatibilityLevel}Guidance:LAN Manager (LM) authentication is the protocol used to authenticate Windows clients for network operations. This includes joining a domain, accessing network resources, and authenticating users or computers. This determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is negotiated between the client and the server computers. Specifically, the LM authentication level determines which authentication protocols the client will try to negotiate or the server will accept. The value set for LmCompatibilityLevel determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This value affects the level of authentication protocol that clients use, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers.Value (Setting) - Description0 (Send LM & NTLM responses) - Clients use LM and NTLM authentication and never use NTLMv2 session security. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.1 (Send LM & NTLM - use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated) - Clients use LM and NTLM authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.2 (Send NTLM response only) - Clients use NTLM authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.3 (Send NTLM v2 response only) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication.4 (Send NTLMv2 response only/refuse LM) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and accept only NTLM and NTLMv2 authentication.5 (Send NTLM v2 response only/refuse LM & NTLM) - Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM and NTLM and accept only NTLMv2 authentication.Incompatibly configured  LmCompatibility levels between a client and server (such as 0 on a client and 5 on a server) prevent access to the server. Non-Microsoft clients and servers also provide these configuration settings.
Microsoft-Windows-SMBServer  |  1022      |  Microsoft-Windows-SMBServer/Connectivity  |  File and printer sharing firewall rule enabled.Guidance:You should expect this event when Windows Firewall is configured to enable the File and Printer Sharing rule, which allows inbound SMB traffic. This event occurs on a computer that has custom shares configured.
Microsoft-Windows-SMBServer  |  1023      |  Microsoft-Windows-SMBServer/Operational   |  One or more shares present on this server have access based enumeration enabled.Guidance:You should expect this event when enabling access-based enumeration on one or more shares by using either Server Manager or the Set-SmbShare Windows PowerShell cmdlet. Access-based enumeration can raise CPU utilization when clients connect to shares with folders containing many peer-level resources to which a user does not have access. You can control the CPU utilization by configuring the ABELevel value in the Windows registry:HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters\ABELevel [DWORD]You can set the value for ABELevel to greater depths to minimize CPU overhead, but doing so diminishes the effectiveness of access-based enumeration:Value = 0: access-based enumeration is enabled for all levelsValue = 1: access-based enumeration is enabled for a depth of 1 (example: \server\share)Value = 2: access-based enumeration is enabled for a depth of 2 (example: \server\share\folder)You can continue setting values for multiple depth levels.
Microsoft-Windows-SMBServer  |  1024      |  Microsoft-Windows-SMBServer/Operational   |  SMB2 and SMB3 have been disabled on this server.  This results in reduced functionality and performance.Registry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\ParametersRegistry Value: Smb2Default Value: 1 (or not present)Current Value: 0Guidance:You should expect this event when disabling SMB2/SMB3. Microsoft does not recommend disabling SMB2/SMB3. When SMB3 is disabled, you cannot use features such as SMB Transparent Failover, SMB Scale Out, SMB Multichannel, SMB Direct (RDMA), SMB Encryption, VSS for SMB file shares, and SMB Directory Leasing. In most scenarios, SMB provides a troubleshooting workaround as an alternative to disabling SMB2/SMB3. Use the Set-SmbServerConfiguration Windows PowerShell cmdlet to enable SMB2/SMB3.
Microsoft-Windows-SMBServer  |  1025      |  Microsoft-Windows-SMBServer/Operational   |  One or more named pipes or shares have been marked for access by anonymous users.  This increases the security risk of the computer by allowing unauthenticated users to connect to this server.Registry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\ParametersRegistry Values: NullSessionPipes, NullSessionSharesDefault Value: Empty (or not present)Current Value: Non-emptyGuidance:You should expect this event when modifying the default values of NullSessionShares and NullSessionPipes. On a typical file server, these settings do not exist or do not contain values, which is the most secure configuration. By default, domain controllers populate the NullSessionShares entry with netlogon, samr, and lsarpc to allow legacy access methods.
Microsoft-Windows-SMBServer  |  1026      |  Microsoft-Windows-SMBServer/Operational   |  File leasing has been disabled for the SMB2 and SMB3 protocols.  This reduces functionality and can decrease performance.Registry Key: HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\ParametersRegistry Value: DisableLeasingDefault Value: 0 (or not present)Current Value: non-zeroGuidance:You should expect this event when disabling SMB 3 Leasing. Microsoft does not recommend disabling SMB Leasing. Once disabled, traffic from client to server may increase since metadata and data may no longer be retrieved from a local cache.
Microsoft-Windows-SMBServer  |  1027      |  Microsoft-Windows-SMBServer/Operational   |  The file and printer sharing firewall ports are currently closed.  This is the default configuration for a system that is not sharing content or is on a Public network.Guidance:You should expect this event when Windows Firewall is not configured to enable the File and Printer Sharing rule, which allows inbound SMB traffic. This event occurs on a computer that does not have custom shares configured. Clients cannot access SMB shares on this computer until SMB traffic is allowed through the firewall.

Microsoft-Windows-SMBServer  |  1030      |  Microsoft-Windows-SMBServer/Operational   |  An MDL read or write completion request failed.Server Name: {ServerName}Share Name: {ShareName}File Name: {FileName}IsRead: {IsRead}Status: {Status}Guidance:The SMB server sends MDL completion requests to a file system upon completion of a buffered I/O to release system resources. The file system and its filter drivers must not fail MDL completion requests. Failures may result in memory leaks and degraded system performance and stability. Non-Microsoft file system filter drivers are the most common cause of failed MDL completion requests.
Microsoft-Windows-SMBServer  |  1031      |  Microsoft-Windows-SMBServer/Operational   |  The server detected a problem and has captured a live kernel dump to collect debug information.Reason: {Reason}Dump Location: %SystemRoot%\LiveKernelReportsGuidance:The server supports the Live Dump feature, where the detection of a problem results in a kernel memory dump, but no bugcheck and reboot. This allows Microsoft Support to examine memory dumps without requiring a reboot or manual intervention. The reason code indicates the type of problem that was detected.Stalled I/OAn I/O is taking an unreasonably long time to complete. Malfunctioning third-party file system minifilter drivers are a common source of this problem. Other causes include failed disks or a client-driven I/O workload that greatly exceeds the server's capacity.
Microsoft-Windows-SMBServer  |  1032      |  Microsoft-Windows-SMBServer/Operational   |  The server detected a problem but was unable to capture a live kernel dump to collect debug information.Reason: {Reason}Guidance:The server supports the Live Dump feature, where the detection of a problem results in a kernel memory dump, but no bugcheck and reboot. This allows Microsoft Support to examine memory dumps without requiring a reboot or manual intervention. The reason code indicates the type of problem that was detected. In this case, the server's request to create a live kernel dump was rejected. This is usually due to the live kernel dump throttle, which prevents frequent dumps from consuming too much disk space. Either wait for the throttle limit to expire (by default, 7 days), or contact Microsoft Support for steps to override the throttle. This event is written to the log no more than once per day. The problem that caused the server to the request a live kernel dump may be occuring more frequently.Stalled I/OAn I/O is taking an unreasonably long time to complete. Malfunctioning third-party file system minifilter drivers are a common source of this problem. Other causes include failed disks or a client-driven I/O workload that greatly exceeds the server's capacity.
