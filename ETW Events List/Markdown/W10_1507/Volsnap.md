Volsnap   |  1         |  System   |  The shadow copy of volume {VolumeNameLength} could not create shadow copy storage on volume {VolumeName}.
Volsnap   |  2         |  System   |  The shadow copy of volume {VolumeNameLength} could not be created because volume {VolumeName}, which is specified as the location for shadow copy storage, is not an NTFS volume or an error was encountered while trying to determine the file system type of this volume.
Volsnap   |  3         |  System   |  The shadow copy of volume {VolumeNameLength} could not lock down the location of the shadow copy storage on volume {VolumeName}.
Volsnap   |  4         |  System   |  The shadow copy of volume {VolumeNameLength} could not be created due to insufficient resources for worker threads.
Volsnap   |  5         |  System   |  The shadow copy of volume {VolumeNameLength} could not be created due to insufficient non-paged memory pool for a bitmap structure.
Volsnap   |  6         |  System   |  The shadow copy of volume {VolumeNameLength} could not create a new paged heap.  The system may be low on virtual memory.
Volsnap   |  7         |  System   |  The shadow copy of volume {VolumeNameLength} failed to query the shadow copy storage mappings on volume {VolumeName}.
Volsnap   |  8         |  System   |  The flush and hold writes operation on volume {VolumeNameLength} timed out while waiting for a release writes command.
Volsnap   |  9         |  System   |  The flush and hold writes operation on volume {VolumeNameLength} timed out while waiting for file system cleanup.

Volsnap   |  15        |  System   |  The shadow copies of volume {VolumeNameLength} were aborted because of insufficient paged heap.
Volsnap   |  16        |  System   |  The shadow copies of volume {VolumeNameLength} were aborted because volume {VolumeName}, which contains shadow copy storage for this shadow copy, was force dismounted.
Volsnap   |  17        |  System   |  An attempt to flush and hold writes on volume {VolumeNameLength} was attempted while another flush and hold was already in progress.
Volsnap   |  20        |  System   |  The shadow copies of volume {VolumeNameLength} were aborted because of a failed free space computation.

Volsnap   |  22        |  System   |  The shadow copy storage volume specified for shadow copies on volume {VolumeNameLength} could not be added.
Volsnap   |  23        |  System   |  There was insufficient disk space on volume {VolumeName} to create the shadow copy of volume {VolumeNameLength}.  Shadow copy storage creation failed.
Volsnap   |  24        |  System   |  There was insufficient disk space on volume {VolumeName} to grow the shadow copy storage for shadow copies of {VolumeNameLength}.  As a result of this failure all shadow copies of volume {VolumeNameLength} are at risk of being deleted.
Volsnap   |  25        |  System   |  The shadow copies of volume {VolumeNameLength} were deleted because the shadow copy storage could not grow in time.  Consider reducing the IO load on the system or choose a shadow copy storage volume that is not being shadow copied.
Volsnap   |  27        |  System   |  The shadow copies of volume {VolumeNameLength} were aborted during detection because a critical control file could not be opened.

Volsnap   |  41        |  System   |  When preparing a new volume shadow copy for volume {VolumeNameLength}, the shadow copy storage on volume {VolumeName} did not have sufficiently large contiguous blocks.  Consider deleting unnecessary files on the shadow copy storage volume or use a different shadow copy storage volume.
Volsnap   |  48        |  System   |  When preparing a new volume shadow copy for volume {VolumeNameLength}, the shadow copy storage on volume {VolumeName} did not have sufficiently large contiguous blocks.  A shadow copy create computation is in progress to find more contiguous blocks.
Volsnap   |  58        |  System   |  The oldest shadow copy of volume {VolumeNameLength} was deleted to keep the total number of shadow copies of volume {VolumeNameLength} below a limit.
Volsnap   |  59        |  System   |  The shadow copies of volume {VolumeNameLength} were aborted because the shadow copy storage volume was not present in time during a previous session.
Volsnap   |  60        |  System   |  The shadow copies of volume {VolumeNameLength} were aborted because volume {VolumeName}, which contains shadow copy storage for this shadow copy, has been taken offline.
Volsnap   |  61        |  System   |  The revert operation on volume {VolumeNameLength} encountered a bad sector error.  Please validate the data on this volume.
Volsnap   |  62        |  System   |  The revert operation on volume {VolumeNameLength} stopped because of the loss of a volume.  When the volume is re-introduced, the revert will continue.  You may have to reboot to trigger the revert.
Volsnap   |  63        |  System   |  An error occurred while trying to delete a snapshot of {VolumeNameLength}.  The delete will be retried at a later time.
